# Silicon Chip and Jaycar Mini Projects

This repo is for code for the Silicon Chip and Jaycar Mini Projects. These are projects developed by
[Silicon Chip](https://www.siliconchip.com.au/)
and
[published in their magazine](https://www.siliconchip.com.au/Series/417).
The projects are sponsored by
[Jaycar Electronics](https://www.jaycar.com.au/).

Not all of the Mini Projects have code, but I will keep the code for the ones that do in this repo.

In the 'src' directory there is a subdirectory with the Mini Project codename, such as JMP001. Within that directory are
'mag' and 'jj5' directories. The 'mag' directory is for the code that was published in the magazine. The 'jj5' directory
is for the code which I changed.

If you're looking for more information the project documentation is mostly here: https://www.jj5.net/wiki/Mini_Projects

I will put another README.md file in the 'jj5' directory for each project with some notes about the changes I made.

Cheers,
Jay Jay.
