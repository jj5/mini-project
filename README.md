# mini-project

This repo is for code for the Silicon Chip and Jaycar Mini Projects.

In the 'src' directory there is a subdirectory with the Mini Project codename, such as JMP001. Within that directory are
'mag' and 'jj5' directories. The 'mag' directory is for the code that was published in the magazine. The 'jj5' directory
is for the code which John changed.

If you're looking for more information the project documentation is mostly here: https://www.jj5.net/wiki/Mini_Projects
