# Silicon Chip and Jaycar Mini Projects

This is a monorepo for code for the Silicon Chip and Jaycar Mini Projects. These are projects developed by
[Silicon Chip](https://www.siliconchip.com.au/)
and
[published in their magazine](https://www.siliconchip.com.au/Series/417).
The projects are sponsored by
[Jaycar Electronics](https://www.jaycar.com.au/).

Not all of the Mini Projects have code, but I will keep the code for the ones that do in this repo.

In the `src` directory there is a subdirectory with the Mini Project codename, such as JMP001, and a suffix of either
`-mag` or `-jj5`.

The `JMPXXX-mag` directory is for a snapshot of the code as published in the magazine.

The `JMPXXX-jj5` directory is for the code which I changed.

If you're looking for more information the project documentation is mostly here:

- https://www.jj5.net/wiki/Mini_Projects

I will put another `README.md` file in the `JMPXXX-jj5` directory for each project with some notes about the changes I made.

I cover all the Silicon Chip and Jaycar Mini Projects on my video blog about electronics, if you're interested in that you
can find it on the web over here:

Cheers,
Jay Jay.
